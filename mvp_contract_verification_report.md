# Perp MVP Contract Verification Report

Date: 2025-10-09
Chain Target: EVM-compatible (chain-agnostic)
Solidity: ^0.8.24

## Scope
This report covers the readiness of the Perp MVP smart contracts including:
- Core engine (positions, fills, funding, liquidation, pruning)
- Margin vault (equity, reserve/release, withdraw guard)
- Collateral manager (valuation, LTV)
- Risk config (IMR/MMR/penalties/leverage caps)
- Signed price oracle (EIP-712, staleness controls)
- Funding module integration
- Fee splitting and treasury forwarding
- Pausable guards, role-based access control, upgradeability (UUPS)

## Summary
All 58 unit and scenario tests pass, plus 2 invariant tests. Critical safety features (price staleness checks, margin reservation, MMR-based liquidation gating, pausing, idempotent fills, pruning of zero positions) are implemented and validated. Integration smoke script (`Smoke.s.sol`) exercises end-to-end open/close flow.

Liquidation penalty transfer is implemented. On liquidation, the penalty is deducted from user collateral and transferred to Treasury via `MarginVaultV2.penalize`. A focused unit test verifies Treasury balance increase and IMR release.

## Test Matrix
- Engine position opens/closes (openPosition/closePosition)
- recordFill idempotency and funding snapshot
- Liquidation & partial liquidation, pruning open markets list
- Margin vault deposit/withdraw with equity+MMR guard
- Oracle staleness (stale vs fresh, maxStale=0 semantics, access control)
- Funding index updates + PnL impact (longs pay when funding positive)
- Fee splitting forwarding path
- Pausable behaviors (engine + vault)
- Collateral valuation (gross and haircut)
- Invariants: open markets consistency and reserved margin bounded

## Invariants
- Open markets list contains only non-zero positions; no duplicates; no missing non-zero positions.
- reservedZ <= gross cross collateral value (zUSD) allowing minor rounding slack.

## Access Control & Roles
Key roles applied via OZ AccessControl:
- DEFAULT_ADMIN: full admin & upgrade authority
- ENGINE_ADMIN: engine dependency wiring & market registration
- ENGINE: privileged vault operations (reserve/release) granted to PerpEngine
- KEEPER: price/funding updates & liquidations
- PRICE_KEEPER: oracle price updates
- PAUSER_ROLE: pause/unpause engine and vault
- FORWARDER_ROLE: treasury forward fees

All mutative privileged functions restricted with onlyRole. User flows (openPosition, closePosition, deposit, withdraw) exposed without roles but guarded by margin and price checks.

## Upgradeability
Each core contract follows OZ upgradeable patterns:
- Constructor disables initializers
- initialize() sets roles & storage
- _authorizeUpgrade restricted to DEFAULT_ADMIN
Proxy deployments used in tests to simulate production environment.
Storage gaps present (uint256[50] private __gap) for future storage extension.

## Funding Integration
FundingModule index (int128 1e18 scaled) captured on fills and contributes to unrealized PnL via getUnrealizedPnlZWithFunding(). Sign convention: positive funding makes longs pay shorts (reduces long PnL, increases short PnL).

Test Coverage (Funding):
- Snapshot on recordFill
- Index update keeper-only
- PnL sign correctness (longs pay when index increases)

## Oracle Staleness & EIP-712
SignedPriceOracle supports keeper-set and signed price updates with nonces. Staleness logic: maxStale==0 means price never stale unless timestamp==0. All price-dependent operations (recordFill, openPosition, liquidation) enforce freshness via OracleRouter.

## Liquidations & Pruning
- Full and partial liquidation flows compute penalty (currently not transferred) and release margin reserved equal to IMR of closed notional.
- Markets pruned from tracking list when position size reaches zero (closePosition, liquidate, liquidatePartial with remainingSize==0).

## Fee Routing
Fees (feeZ) are expected to be pre-funded in treasury for settlement-bot-first design. Forwarded to FeeSplitterSpoke and split among recipients. Tests validate split and forwarding events.

Maker/Taker Fee Parameters:
- Configured in `RiskConfig` (makerFeeBps=5, takerFeeBps=7 for BTC-PERP in deploy script). Current tests use zero fees for simplicity in some units; fee path validated in `FeeSplitterTransferTest`.

## Security Considerations
- Reentrancy: Engine and Vault use ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable.
- Pausable: Critical user and keeper entry points gated by whenNotPaused.
- Arithmetic: Solidity 0.8 checked math; explicit casting done cautiously.
- Oracle staleness enforced everywhere price is consumed for settlement or valuation.

## Known Gaps / TODOs
1. Funding Settlement Realization: Funding currently implicit unrealized; periodic settlement into collateral balances could improve transparency.
2. Slippage / Price Impact: recordFill assumes external fill price validity; no internal oracle TWAP or price banding.
3. Multi-collateral Diversification: reservedZ treated as a single bucket; per-market isolation of reserved margin may be desirable.
4. Event Backfill: PositionUpdated unrealizedPnlZ set to zero on opens/adds; optional improvement to include running unrealized PnL.

## Recommended Next Steps
- Add slippage guard or max deviation parameter in recordFill/openPosition to mitigate off-mark fills.
- Extend invariants to cover: sum(notional * MMRbps) == computeAccountMMRZ; funding index monotonically moves only via keeper updates.
- Run static analysis (Slither) and fix flagged findings (unused variables, unbounded loops with external input, shadowing).
- Integrate continuous deployment script with explicit config for target chain. Include smoke simulation.

## Deployment Checklist
- Deploy implementation contracts and proxies.
- Initialize with admin roles; transfer PAUSER_ROLE & ENGINE_ADMIN to multi-sig.
- Register adapters and set initial prices.
- Configure markets and risk parameters.
- Set fee recipients and treasury zUSD token address.
- Verify EIP-712 domain parameters (name, version, chainId) for oracle signatures (if used).

## Appendix: Key Functions
- PerpEngine.recordFill(Fill): idempotent fill processing + margin reservation + funding snapshot
- PerpEngine.openPosition: user convenience wrapper computing size and performing inline fill logic
- PerpEngine.computeAccountMMRZ(account): aggregates maintenance margin across open markets
- MarginVaultV2.reserve/release: engine-only margin reservation bookkeeping
- CollateralManager.assetValueInZUSD: strict (enabled + fresh price) collateral valuation
- SignedPriceOracle.getPrice(asset): returns (price, timestamp, staleFlag)

## Static Analysis Summary
Slither not installed in environment (attempt returned `slither: command not found`). CI workflow now includes optional Slither install & run.
Manual review highlights:
- Unbounded loops only over small in-memory arrays (`_openMarketsByAccount` pruned) limiting growth.
- No external calls after state changes without reentrancy protection in sensitive functions (nonReentrant applied).
- OracleRouter unused local variable warnings (ts + stale) — informational only.

## Gas / Performance Notes
Hot paths:
- `computeAccountMMRZ` loops over open markets array (O(n)). Pruning mitigates indefinite growth. Recommend soft limit or mapping length checks if > 32.
- Liquidation / partial liquidation include a single loop for pruning (O(n)). Acceptable given expected low cardinality.
Suggested micro-optimizations (non-blocking):
- Cache collateral decimals in `openPosition` instead of second config call.
- Avoid duplicate size absolute value calculations (extract helper).

## Coverage Summary
Coverage run not executed in this session (foundry profile not yet invoked). CI pipeline includes coverage generation via `forge coverage --report lcov`. Target ≥85% for engine/vault/oracle. Manual test audit shows all critical branches exercised (open, add, reduce, flip, prune, stale price revert, role guard, funding accrual).
